Figure 2 shows the tool to make the queries. To implement a query just add the location of the stations for the synthetics be generated. Choose a model, units (velocity, displacement or acceleration) the source coordinates and time spam and, very important, the type of source and the focal parameters.","\n  ","\n  ","Once the query is done and the synthetic seismograms are saved in the location path you had selected, you can plot the synthetic seismograms and  the map/focal mechanism for give a first eye to the results.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    ","ISP_Documentation","                                                                                                        ","Page ","1"," of\n      ","1","\n        ","\n    ","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["Synthetics generator"],"id":"2"})
