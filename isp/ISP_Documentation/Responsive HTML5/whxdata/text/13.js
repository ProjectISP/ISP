If it is already loaded for the H-k analysis, it will not be necessary to load it again. The second step is to read the saved receiver functions. This can be done under ‘Input > CCP Stacking > Read RFs …’. Triggering this option will display an open file dialog, in which the directory containing the receiver function files must be selected. Once loaded, switch to the “CCP Stacking” tab in the main window. A map of the stations with available receiver functions will be in display. The stacking is performed over a user-defined grid. This can be done either manually (pressing the ‘Manual selection’ button in the ‘Grid.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    ","ISP_Documentation","                                                                                                        ","Page ","1"," of\n      ","1","\n        ","\n    ","\n  ","\n\n"]],"2":[["Back Tracing and CCP stack"]],"id":"13"})
