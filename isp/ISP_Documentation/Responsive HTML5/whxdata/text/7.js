","\n  ","\n  ","\n    "," Units must be on velocity, so you must remove the response of the instrument to velocity, previously to open the Magnitudes window. For Local magnitude you have to remove the response of Wood-Anderson instrument.","\n    "," The hypocenter must be already calculated. The program will read the *.hyp file before open Magnitudes window.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","If you place 0.00 on all parameters of local or coda magnitudes, the program will calculate these magnitude with default parameters as follows:","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","Coda Magnitude:","\n  ","# Values for California","\n            ","a = ","2.0; ","b = ","0.0035; ","c= -","0.87","\n  ","\n  ","Mc_value = a*np.log10(t_coda)+b*dist+c","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","Local Magnitude:","\n  ","\n  ","a = ","1.11; ","b =","0.00189; ","c= -","2.09","\n  ","\n  ","ML_value = np.log10(max_amplitude)+","a","*np.log10(dist)+","b","*dist+","c","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","Briefly, Once you have open the Magnitude Window, select the magnitudes you want to compute and run the computation.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","In the upper panel it is shown the spectrum of the body waves and the fit to calculate the moment magnitude. In the bottom panel is shown the histograms of all magnitudes (the result of the magnitudes for all seismograms for all kind of magnitudes) and on the left an additional plot used to visualize the dispersion of the results.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","Magnitudes example","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    ","ISP_Documentation","                                                                                                        ","Page ","1"," of\n      ","1","\n        ","\n    ","\n  ","\n\n"],"id":"7"})
